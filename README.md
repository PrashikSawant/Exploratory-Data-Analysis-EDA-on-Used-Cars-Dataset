# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Used Cars Dataset

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a dataset of used cars. The goal is to analyze trends, identify key insights, and clean the data for further modeling or decision-making.

## 📂 Dataset Information
- The dataset contains information about **7,253 used cars**.
- Features include:
  - **Car Name**
  - **Location**
  - **Year of Manufacture**
  - **Kilometers Driven**
  - **Fuel Type** (Petrol/Diesel/CNG/Electric)
  - **Transmission** (Manual/Automatic)
  - **Owner Type** (First/Second/Third Owner)
  - **Mileage**
  - **Engine Power**
  - **Seats**
  - **Price** (Target Variable)

## 🔍 Steps in EDA
1. **Importing necessary libraries**
2. **Reading the dataset**
3. **Understanding the data** (Checking missing values, duplicates, data types, etc.)
4. **Data Cleaning & Wrangling** (Handling missing values, outliers, inconsistencies)
5. **Feature Engineering** (Creating new features or modifying existing ones)
6. **Data Visualization**
   - Univariate Analysis (Histograms, Boxplots, etc.)
   - Bivariate Analysis (Scatterplots, Correlations, etc.)
   - Multivariate Analysis (Heatmaps, Pairplots, etc.)
7. **Key Insights & Findings**

## 📊 Key Insights
- **Distribution of car prices:** Majority of cars are priced within a specific range.
- **Fuel type trends:** Diesel cars tend to be more expensive than petrol ones.
- **Impact of transmission type:** Automatic cars are generally priced higher than manual cars.
- **Mileage vs. Price correlation:** Higher mileage vehicles tend to be priced lower.

## 🛠️ How to Run the Notebook
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/EDA-Used-Cars.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd EDA-Used-Cars
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook EDA_Used_Cars.ipynb
   ```

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Feature selection for predictive modeling.
- Price prediction using machine learning algorithms.
- Interactive visualizations using **Plotly** or **Dash**.
- More detailed statistical analysis.
